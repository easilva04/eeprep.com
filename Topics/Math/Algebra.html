                <ol class="index">
                    <li><strong>Linear Equations</strong>:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Solving single-variable equations: \(ax + b = 0\)
                                <p>To solve for \(x\), isolate the variable by subtracting \(b\) from both sides and then dividing by \(a\). For example, if \(2x + 3 = 0\), subtract 3 from both sides to get \(2x = -3\), and then divide by 2 to get \(x = -\frac{3}{2}\).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Systems of linear equations: Using methods such as substitution, elimination, and matrix operations.
                                <p>Substitution involves solving one equation for one variable and substituting that expression into another equation. For example, if you have \(x + y = 5\) and \(2x - y = 3\), solve the first equation for \(y\) to get \(y = 5 - x\), and substitute into the second equation to get \(2x - (5 - x) = 3\).</p>
                                <p>Elimination involves adding or subtracting equations to eliminate a variable. For example, if you have \(x + y = 5\) and \(x - y = 1\), add the equations to get \(2x = 6\), so \(x = 3\). Then substitute \(x = 3\) back into one of the original equations to find \(y\).</p>
                                <p>Matrix operations use matrices and row reduction techniques to solve systems of equations. For example, the system \(x + y = 5\) and \(2x - y = 3\) can be written as a matrix equation and solved using Gaussian elimination.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Slope-Intercept Form: \( y = mx + b \)
                                <p>This form represents a linear equation where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept. It is useful for quickly graphing linear equations. For example, if \(y = 2x + 3\), the slope is 2 and the y-intercept is 3. This means the line rises 2 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right, and it crosses the y-axis at \(y = 3\).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Point-Slope Form: \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)
                                <p>This form is used to write the equation of a line when you know the slope \(m\) and a point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the line. For example, if the slope is 2 and the point is (1, 3), the equation is \(y - 3 = 2(x - 1)\).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Standard Form: \( Ax + By = C \)
                                <p>This form is useful for solving systems of linear equations and for analyzing the intercepts of the line. For example, if the equation is \(2x + 3y = 6\), the x-intercept is found by setting \(y = 0\) and solving for \(x\), and the y-intercept is found by setting \(x = 0\) and solving for \(y\).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Graphing linear equations and understanding intercepts.
                                <p>Graphing involves plotting points that satisfy the equation and drawing a line through them. The x-intercept is where the line crosses the x-axis, and the y-intercept is where it crosses the y-axis. For example, for the equation \(y = 2x + 3\), the y-intercept is 3, and you can find another point by choosing a value for \(x\) and solving for \(y\).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Applications in circuit analysis and signal processing.
                                <p>Linear equations are used to model and solve problems in electrical circuits, such as finding currents and voltages. For example, Ohm's Law \(V = IR\) is a linear equation. They are also used in signal processing to analyze and filter signals, such as using Fourier transforms to decompose signals into their frequency components.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Linear inequalities and their solutions.
                                <p>Linear inequalities are similar to linear equations but involve inequality signs. Solutions are often represented as ranges or regions on a graph. For example, the inequality \(2x + 3 > 5\) can be solved by isolating \(x\) to get \(x > 1\). This solution can be represented on a number line or a coordinate plane.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Applications in optimization problems in engineering.
                                <p>Linear inequalities are used in optimization problems to define constraints and feasible regions. Techniques such as linear programming are used to find optimal solutions. For example, maximizing profit or minimizing cost subject to resource constraints can be formulated as a linear programming problem.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Graphing linear inequalities.
                                <p>Graphing involves shading the region that satisfies the inequality. The boundary line is dashed for strict inequalities and solid for inclusive inequalities. For example, the inequality \(y > 2x + 3\) is graphed by drawing the line \(y = 2x + 3\) and shading the region above the line.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Understanding and solving absolute value equations.
                                <p>Absolute value equations involve expressions within absolute value bars. They are solved by considering both the positive and negative cases of the expression inside the bars. For example, the equation \(|x - 3| = 2\) has two solutions: \(x - 3 = 2\) and \(x - 3 = -2\), which give \(x = 5\) and \(x = 1\).</p>

                        <h4>How to Solve Linear Equations</h4>
                        <p>1. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.</p>
                        <p>2. Simplify both sides of the equation.</p>
                        <p>3. Check your solution by substituting it back into the original equation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Quadratic Equations</strong>:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Standard form: \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)
                                <p>This is the general form of a quadratic equation, where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants. The solutions to this equation are the values of \(x\) that make the equation true. For example, in the equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0\), \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = -2\). The standard form is useful for applying various solution techniques and understanding the properties of the quadratic function.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Solution techniques: Factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula.
                                <p>Factoring involves expressing the quadratic equation as a product of two binomials. For example, \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\) can be factored as \((x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\), giving solutions \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3\). This method is straightforward when the quadratic can be easily factored.</p>
                                <p>Completing the square involves rewriting the quadratic equation in the form \((x - p)^2 = q\). For example, \(x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\) can be rewritten as \((x + 3)^2 - 4 = 0\), giving solutions \(x = -3 \pm 2\). This method is useful for deriving the vertex form of the quadratic function and understanding its geometric properties.</p>
                                <p>The quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) provides a direct way to find the solutions of any quadratic equation. For example, for the equation \(2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0\), the solutions are \(x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}\), giving \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(x = -2\). This formula is derived from completing the square on the standard form and is applicable to all quadratic equations.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Factored Form: \( a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0 \)
                                <p>This form expresses the quadratic equation as a product of its roots \(r_1\) and \(r_2\). For example, if the roots of the equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\) are \(2\) and \(3\), the factored form is \( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \). This form is useful for quickly identifying the roots and understanding the behavior of the quadratic function at those points.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Vertex Form: \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \)
                                <p>This form highlights the vertex \((h, k)\) of the parabola represented by the quadratic function. For example, the equation \(y = 2(x - 1)^2 + 3\) has a vertex at \((1, 3)\), and the parabola opens upwards with a vertical stretch factor of \(2\). The vertex form is useful for graphing the quadratic function and understanding its maximum or minimum value.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Quadratic Formula: \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)
                                <p>This formula provides the solutions to any quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). It is derived from completing the square on the standard form of the quadratic equation. The term under the square root, \(b^2 - 4ac\), is called the discriminant and determines the nature of the roots. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots; if it is zero, there is one real root (a repeated root); and if it is negative, there are two complex roots.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Graphing quadratic functions and understanding parabolas.
                                <p>Quadratic functions graph as parabolas, which are U-shaped curves. The direction of the parabola (upward or downward) is determined by the sign of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards; if \(a < 0\), it opens downwards. The vertex is the highest or lowest point on the graph, and the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through the vertex. For example, the graph of \(y = x^2 - 4x + 3\) is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at \((2, -1)\). The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis, and the x-intercepts (if they exist) are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Applications in control systems and signal processing.
                                <p>Quadratic equations are used in control systems to model and analyze system behavior, such as determining stability and response characteristics. For example, the characteristic equation of a second-order system is a quadratic equation that helps determine the system's natural frequency and damping ratio. In signal processing, quadratic equations are used to design filters and analyze signal properties. For example, a quadratic filter can be used to remove noise from a signal or to enhance certain frequency components.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Complex roots and their interpretation.
                                <p>When the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\) is negative, the quadratic equation has complex roots. These roots are conjugate pairs of the form \(p \pm qi\), where \(i\) is the imaginary unit. Complex roots indicate oscillatory behavior in systems, such as in electrical circuits with resonance. For example, the equation \(x^2 + 4 = 0\) has roots \(x = \pm 2i\). In engineering, complex roots are often associated with systems that exhibit oscillations or resonance, and they provide important information about the system's stability and response.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Applications in analyzing resonance in circuits.
                                <p>Quadratic equations are used to analyze resonance in electrical circuits, such as RLC circuits. The natural frequency and damping factor of the circuit are determined by solving the characteristic quadratic equation. Resonance occurs when the circuit's natural frequency matches the frequency of an external source, leading to maximum energy transfer. For example, in an RLC circuit, the characteristic equation \(L\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{i}{C} = 0\) is a quadratic equation in terms of the complex frequency variable, and its solutions provide information about the circuit's resonant frequency and damping behavior.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Solving quadratic inequalities.
                                <p>Quadratic inequalities involve expressions like \(ax^2 + bx + c > 0\) or \(ax^2 + bx + c < 0\). Solutions are often represented as intervals on the number line. For example, the inequality \(x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0\) has solutions \(x < 2\) or \(x > 3\), which can be found by solving the corresponding quadratic equation and analyzing the sign of the expression in each interval. Graphically, the solutions to a quadratic inequality correspond to the regions where the parabola is above or below the x-axis. These solutions are important in optimization problems and in defining feasible regions for engineering applications.</p>

                        <h4>How to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
                        <p>1. Write the equation in standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).</p>
                        <p>2. Use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula to find the solutions.</p>
                        <p>3. Verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Inequalities</strong>:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Solving linear and quadratic inequalities.
                                <p>Linear inequalities involve expressions like \(ax + b > c\) or \(ax + b < c\). To solve them, isolate the variable on one side of the inequality. For example, to solve \(2x + 3 > 7\), subtract 3 from both sides to get \(2x > 4\), then divide by 2 to get \(x > 2\). Quadratic inequalities involve expressions like \(ax^2 + bx + c > 0\) or \(ax^2 + bx + c < 0\). These are solved by finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation and analyzing the sign of the expression in each interval. For example, to solve \(x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0\), find the roots \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3\), and determine that the solution is \(x < 2\) or \(x > 3\).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Graphical representation of solutions.
                                <p>Graphical representation involves plotting the inequality on a number line or coordinate plane. For linear inequalities, this means shading the region that satisfies the inequality. For example, for \(x > 2\), shade the region to the right of 2 on the number line. For quadratic inequalities, graph the corresponding quadratic function and identify the regions where the function is above or below the x-axis. This visual approach helps in understanding the solution set and the behavior of the inequality.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Linear: \( ax + b > c \) or \( ax + b < c \)
                                <p>These inequalities are solved by isolating the variable \(x\). For example, to solve \(3x - 4 < 5\), add 4 to both sides to get \(3x < 9\), then divide by 3 to get \(x < 3\). The solution can be represented on a number line or a coordinate plane. This method is straightforward and helps in quickly determining the range of values that satisfy the inequality.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Absolute Value Inequalities: \( |x| < a \rightarrow -a < x < a \)
                                <p>Absolute value inequalities involve expressions within absolute value bars. For \( |x| < a \), the solution is the range \(-a < x < a\). For example, \( |x| < 3 \) means \(-3 < x < 3\). This can be represented on a number line by shading the region between -3 and 3. Absolute value inequalities are useful in defining ranges and tolerances in engineering applications.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Absolute Value Inequalities: \( |x| > a \rightarrow x < -a \text{ or } x > a \)
                                <p>For \( |x| > a \), the solution is \(x < -a\) or \(x > a\). For example, \( |x| > 2 \) means \(x < -2\) or \(x > 2\). This can be represented on a number line by shading the regions to the left of -2 and to the right of 2. These inequalities are often used in scenarios where values must be outside a certain range, such as in safety margins and error bounds.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Compound inequalities and their solutions.
                                <p>Compound inequalities involve two or more inequalities combined by "and" or "or". For example, \(1 < x < 4\) is a compound inequality that means \(x\) is between 1 and 4. The solution is the intersection of the solutions to each inequality. For "or" inequalities, the solution is the union of the solutions to each inequality. Compound inequalities are common in optimization problems where multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Applications in optimization problems in engineering.
                                <p>Inequalities are used in optimization problems to define constraints and feasible regions. Techniques such as linear programming are used to find optimal solutions. For example, maximizing profit or minimizing cost subject to resource constraints can be formulated as an optimization problem with inequalities. These techniques are widely used in operations research, logistics, and resource management.</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>Parametric equations and polar coordinates.
                                <p>Parametric equations represent curves by expressing the coordinates as functions of a parameter. Polar coordinates represent points in terms of their distance from the origin and angle from the positive x-axis. These concepts are used in physics, engineering, and computer graphics.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Vectors and their applications in physics and engineering.
                                <p>Vectors are quantities with both magnitude and direction. They are used to represent forces, velocities, and other physical quantities. Operations with vectors include addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. Vectors are essential in physics and engineering for analyzing motion and forces.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Conic sections: Parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas.
                                <p>Conic sections are curves obtained by intersecting a plane with a cone. Parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas have unique properties and equations. These curves are used in physics, astronomy, and engineering to model various phenomena.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Complex numbers and their properties.
                                <p>Complex numbers have a real part and an imaginary part, represented as \(a + bi\). They are used to solve equations that have no real solutions and to model oscillatory behavior in engineering and physics. Operations with complex numbers include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
