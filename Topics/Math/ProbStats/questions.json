    "question": "A circuit contains 5 resistors in parallel, each with reliability 0.9 (probability of not failing). What is the reliability of the entire circuit? (Round to 4 decimal places)",
    "options": [
      "0.9000",
      "0.9900",
      "0.9999",
      "0.5905"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "In a parallel configuration, the system fails only if all components fail. If R is reliability, then:\n\nR_system = 1 - (1 - R)^5 = 1 - (1 - 0.9)^5 = 1 - 0.1^5 = 1 - 0.00001 = 0.99999 ≈ 0.9999"

    "explanation": "We need to find P(X > 13) where X ~ N(12, 0.5²).\n\nFirst, convert to standard normal: z = (13 - 12)/0.5 = 2\n\nP(X > 13) = P(Z > 2) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228"

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Using Bayes' theorem: P(Defective|Positive) = [P(Positive|Defective) × P(Defective)] / P(Positive)\n\nP(Defective) = 0.05\nP(Good) = 0.95\nP(Positive|Defective) = 0.98\nP(Positive|Good) = 0.03\n\nP(Positive) = P(Positive|Defective) × P(Defective) + P(Positive|Good) × P(Good)\n= 0.98 × 0.05 + 0.03 × 0.95\n= 0.049 + 0.0285\n= 0.0775\n\nP(Defective|Positive) = (0.98 × 0.05) / 0.0775 = 0.049 / 0.0775 = 0.6329"
