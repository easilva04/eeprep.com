                <h3>Resistors</h3>
                <p>Resistors are components that resist the flow of electric current. They are characterized by their
                    resistance value, measured in ohms (Ω).</p>
                <h3>Capacitors</h3>
                <p>Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field. They are characterized by their capacitance
                    value, measured in farads (F).</p>
                <h3>Inductors</h3>
                <p>Inductors store energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through them. They are
                    characterized by their inductance value, measured in henrys (H).</p>

                <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
                <p>Ohm's Law states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional
                    to
                    the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R). The formula
                    is
                    given by:</p>
                <p>\[ V = IR \]</p>

                <h2>Series and Parallel Circuits</h2>
                <h3>Series Circuits</h3>
                <p>In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end, so the same current flows through each
                    component. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances:</p>
                <p>\[ R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n \]</p>
                <h3>Parallel Circuits</h3>
                <p>In a parallel circuit, components are connected across the same two points, so the voltage across
                    each
                    component is the same. The total resistance is given by:</p>
                <p>\[ \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n} \]</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Kirchhoff's Laws</h2>
                <h3>Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)</h3>
                <p>KCL states that the total current entering a junction is equal to the total current leaving the
                    junction:
                </p>
                <p>\[ \sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} \]</p>
                <h3>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</h3>
                <p>KVL states that the sum of the electrical potential differences (voltage) around any closed network
                    is
                    zero:</p>
                <p>\[ \sum V = 0 \]</p>

                <h2>Thevenin's and Norton's Theorems</h2>
                <h3>Thevenin's Theorem</h3>
                <p>Thevenin's Theorem states that any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and
                    resistances can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a single voltage source and a
                    series
                    resistance.</p>
                <h3>Norton's Theorem</h3>
                <p>Norton's Theorem states that any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and
                    resistances can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a single current source and a
                    parallel resistance.</p>
