                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>EE Prep began as a collection of study notes and resources compiled by electrical engineering students preparing for exams and professional certifications. Recognizing the need for a centralized, well-organized repository of electrical engineering knowledge, we developed this platform to share these resources with the wider engineering community.</p>
                <p>Today, EE Prep continues to grow with contributions from educators, students, and industry professionals who share our passion for electrical engineering education.</p>
